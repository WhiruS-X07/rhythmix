# 🎶 Rhythmix

Rhythmix is a **music streaming web app** built with **PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, TailwindCSS**.  
It allows users to upload, browse, and listen to songs with a clean, modern UI and a custom draggable player.

## 🚀 Project Evolution

I’m building Rhythmix step by step. Here’s how it has evolved:

### ✅ **Version 1 – Initial Setup**
- Basic project structure created (PHP + MySQL + Tailwind).
- Database connection with backend integration.
- Can retrieve songs (title, artist, cover image, file) from MySQL database.
- Display songs as cards on the homepage.
- Added a simple audio player (`<audio>` tag) to play music files.

---

### 🎵 **Version 2 – Player Upgrade**
- Introduced a **custom audio player UI** (instead of default browser player).
- Show song title, artist, and progress bar.
- Added controls: **Play / Pause**, **Next / Previous**, **Repeat**, and **Like** button (UI only for now).
- Songs can be played directly by clicking the play button on each card.
- Added a **progress bar** that updates with song time.
- Implemented **draggable player** → user can move the player window anywhere on screen.

---

### 🎨 **Version 3 – UI Enhancements (Current Version)**
- Responsive layout with **Tailwind**:
  - Works across mobile, tablet, and desktop.
  - Song cards adjust columns dynamically (`grid-cols-1 … grid-cols-7`).
- Player design improved with:
  - Glassmorphism effect (`backdrop-blur-md`, transparency).
  - Rounded corners, shadows, hover animations.
  - Custom draggable popup player (instead of fixed bottom bar).
